## Data delivery

### Generating reports

- [ ] Log in into Miarka
- [ ] Move to the project directory and submit the report job:
```bash
cd <ngi_path>/ANALYSIS/<project_id> && ngi_reports project_summary -p <project_id> -s '<author_name>'`
```

This step creates the `reports` directory

Open the markdown file in the `reports` directory, and check the following:

- [ ] All flowcells are listed
- [ ] The read counts are correct
- [ ] No deviation note should be added
- [ ] The index sequences are correct
- [ ] No new samples should be added

If any of the above points are not correct, you can edit the markdown file directly, and then run the following command to re-generate the final report:
```bash
make_report [Project_name]_project_summary.md
```
